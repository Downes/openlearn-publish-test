<h1>How to get a badge</h1>
<p>Getting a badge is straightforward! Here’s what you have to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>read each week of the course</p></li>
<li><p>score 50% or more in the two badge quizzes in Week 4 and Week 8.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all the quizzes, you can have three attempts at most of the questions (for true or false type questions you usually only get one attempt). If you get the answer right first time you will get more marks than for a correct answer the second or third time. If one of your answers is incorrect you will often receive helpful feedback and suggestions about how to work out the correct answer.</p>
<p>For the badge quizzes, if you’re not successful in getting 50% the first time, after 24 hours you can attempt the whole quiz, and come back as many times as you like.</p>
<p>We hope that as many people as possible will gain an Open University badge – so you should see getting a badge as an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned rather than as a test.</p>
<p>If you need more guidance on getting a badge and what you can do with it, take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/about-openlearn/frequently-asked-questions-on-openlearn">OpenLearn FAQs</a><span class="link-target"> [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/about-openlearn/frequently-asked-questions-on-openlearn]</span>. When you gain your badge you will receive an email to notify you and you will be able to view and manage all your badges in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/my-openlearn">My OpenLearn</a><span class="link-target"> [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/my-openlearn]</span> within 24 hours of completing the criteria to gain a badge.</p>
